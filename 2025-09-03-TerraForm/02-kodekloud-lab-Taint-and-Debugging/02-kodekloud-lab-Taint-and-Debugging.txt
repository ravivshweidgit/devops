Terra form AWS kodekloud AWS Taint and debugging
==================================================


1 / 8
Which environment variable should be used to export the logs to a specific path?
If unsure, refer to the documentation. Documentation tab is available at the top right.
TF_LOG_PATH


2 / 8
Can you export the debug logs from terraform just by setting TF_LOG_PATH environment variable and providing a path as the value to this variable?
NO


3 / 8
We have a configuration directory called /root/terraform-projects/ProjectA. Enable logging with the log level set to ERROR and then export the logs the path /tmp/ProjectA.log.
Once the environment variables are set, run a terraform init and apply.
It's OK if this results in an error. Do not change any configuration files before you export the logs!

cd /root/terraform-projects/ProjectA
export TF_LOG=ERROR
export TF_LOG_PATH=/tmp/ProjectA.log
terraform init
terraform apply


apply log:
Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.ProjectA: Creating...
╷
│ Error: creating EC2 Instance: AuthFailure: AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials
│       status code: 401, request id: ae7655b3-1c10-4b3d-9927-048e3d323cf8
│ 
│   with aws_instance.ProjectA,
│   on main.tf line 1, in resource "aws_instance" "ProjectA":
│    1: resource "aws_instance" "ProjectA" {


4 / 8
Which Log Level provides the most details when you run terraform commands?
answer : Trace


5 / 8
Now navigate to /root/terraform-projects/ProjectB. We already have a main.tf file created for provisioning an AWS EC2 instance with the tag Name: projectb_webserver.

Run a terraform init and apply to provision this instance.

cd ../ProjectB

apply log:

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.ProjectB: Creating...
aws_instance.ProjectB: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.ProjectB: Creation complete after 10s [id=i-7204508d51cc45d9a]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.


6 / 8
Now, try running a terraform plan again. What is the effect?

plan log
 # aws_instance.ProjectB is tainted, so must be replaced
Resourcsed will be replaced

7 / 8
Why is the resource called ProjectB being replaced?
ProjectB resource is Tained


8 / 8
Untaint the resource called ProjectB so that the resource is not replaced any more.
The resource is currently tainted.

❯ terraform untaint aws_instance.ProjectB
Resource instance aws_instance.ProjectB has been successfully untainted.
