Please create detailed md document to explain the below :


VPC
=======================



search "vpc" got vpc

https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=eu-north-1#Home:


VPC dashboard -> your vpc -> 


create vpc
VPC settings : vpc and more 
Name tag auto-generation : lab
PC endpoints : none



Create EC2 bastion
ec2 -> instances -> Launch -> 

Name and tags : bastion
Network settings
vpc : lab
subne : public 1


Create EC2 NAT
ec2 -> instances -> launch -> 

Name and tags : nat
Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)  : amzn-ami-vpc-nat  -> Community AMIs  pick first -> launch


Netwrk settings 
VPC : lab-vpc
Subnet : public1


Auto-assign public IP : enable



Launch ..



create security group for the  nat
create Inbound rule :
Type : All traffic  
Source : 10.0.0.0/16 

Goto NAT instance -> Action -> Networking -> Change Source / destination check -> Check stop -> save (because this is NAT i dont want to check this)
Stop and start NAT instance


This will allow machine inside private to comunicate to the internet:
VPC -> rout tables -> check lab-rtb-private1-eu-north-1a -> Routs -> Edit routs -> 
Add rout -> 
Destination : 0.0.0.0/0
Target : Instance + i-0a5422b20ad5df8fb(nat) -> save changes



another ec2 machine in the private
Ec2 launche instance
name : private
Network settings : lab
Subnet : private1
Launce instance


Ec2 : instances : bastion : connect :

Instance ID

i-0ec2f559a130315df (bastion)
Open an SSH client.

Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is key01.pem

Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
chmod 400 "key01.pem"

Connect to your instance using its Private IP:
10.0.4.212

Example:

ssh -i "key01.pem" ec2-user@10.0.4.212

now we need to copy the private key to the bastion
Now if we connect to the private it will connect us to the private machine through the bastion.


Now another method to connect to private machine
IAM -> roles > create role > permision policies search "ssm" : AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore > role "basic-ssm" > create role

Ec2 > instances > private > securioty > modify iam role > basic-ssm.
Stop/start pricate ec2.

private > connect > session manager > connect : connect throuh the web browser .
