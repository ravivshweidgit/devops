Kodekloud lab : Terraform modules
=================================


1 / 11
A configuration directory has been created at the path /root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire. Inspect the main.tf file created in this directory and answer the following questions.

OK


2 / 11
Which configuration block is defined in the main.tf file at the moment?

module "iam_iam-user" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-user"
  version = "5.28.0"
  # insert the 1 required variable here
}

mudule


3 / 11
What is the source of the module used in this configuration?

source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-user"
public terrafomr registry


4 / 11
What is the version of the module used?
version = "5.28.0"


5 / 11
How many required arguments does this module expect?
You may need to look up the documentation to figure this one out.
Refer: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest/submodules/iam-user

answer : 1  argument name


6 / 11
Which argument is to be specified, just to create an IAM User with this module?
You may need to look up the documentation to figure this one out.
Refer: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest/submodules/iam-user
answer : name


7 / 11
Now, update this module block that will allow it to create an IAM User called max. Adhere to the following requirements:

Only use the module block in the main.tf file, do not add a separate resource block.
Module Name - iam_iam-user
Only add the single required argument at this time.


The provider.tf and variables.tf files have been added to this configuration directory now.

When ready, run a terraform init and plan. You don't have to provision the resources at this moment but you can try should you wish to!


main:
module "iam_iam-user"  {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-user"
  version = "5.28.0"
  # insert the 1 required variable here

  name = "max"
}



terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.11.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region                      = var.region
  skip_credentials_validation = true
  skip_requesting_account_id  = true
  endpoints {
    iam = "http://aws:4566"
    ec2 = "http://aws:4566"
    s3 = "http://aws:4566"
  }
}


variable "region" {
    default = "us-east-1"
}

8 / 11
How many resources are set to be created in the execution plan ?
Inspect the output of the terraform plan command.
Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.


9 / 11
Which resources are set to be created?

# module.iam_iam-user.aws_iam_access_key.this_no_pgp[0] will be created
# module.iam_iam-user.aws_iam_user.this[0] will be created
# module.iam_iam-user.aws_iam_user_login_profile.this[0] will be created 


10 / 11
Why is the module creating additional resources, when only the name for creating an IAM User was defined in the main.tf file?
Inspect the Inputs for this module in the documentation:
https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest/submodules/iam-user


answer : resources will be created by default as per module configuration



11 / 11
We only want to create the IAM User. Update the module block to only allow create_user. Disable create_iam_access_key and create_iam_user_login_profile.
When ready, run the terraform workflow to create the resources.

module "iam_iam-user"  {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-user"
  version = "5.28.0"
  # insert the 1 required variable here

  name = "max"

    # Explicitly create the IAM user. This is the default behavior,
  # but setting it to 'true' makes the intent clear.
  create_user = true

  # Set to 'false' to disable the creation of an IAM access key.
  create_iam_access_key = false

  # Set to 'false' to disable the creation of a login profile for the user.
  create_iam_user_login_profile = false
}

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

module.iam_iam-user.aws_iam_user.this[0]: Creating...
module.iam_iam-user.aws_iam_user.this[0]: Creation complete after 0s [id=max]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
