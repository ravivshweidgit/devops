Kodekloud Terraform workspaces
================================


1 / 11
When we start off and create a configuration in terraform, what is the workspace that is created, to begin with?
deafulat worspace


2 / 11
Navigate to the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire. We have a few configuration files already created here. How may workspaces are created for this configuration currently?

‚ùØ terraform workspace list
* default


3 / 11
Create three new workspaces called us-payroll, uk-payroll and india-payroll.

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform workspace new us-payroll
Created and switched to workspace "us-payroll"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† us-payroll on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform workspace new uk-payroll
Created and switched to workspace "uk-payroll"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† uk-payroll on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform workspace new india-payroll
Created and switched to workspace "india-payroll"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.


4 / 11
Now, switch to the workspace called us-payroll.

‚ùØ terraform workspace select us-payroll
Switched to workspace "us-payroll".


5 / 11
Where would the state file for the workspace called india-payroll be stored??
Choose the correct path relative to the current configuration directory (/root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire)

root in project-sapphire/terraform.tfstate.d/india-payroll on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ pwd
/root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire/terraform.tfstate.d/india-payroll


6 / 11
Let's now write the main.tf file to make use of the same module that we saw in the terraform modules lecture.
The project-sapphire configuration directory will be used to deploy the same payroll application stack in different regions.
The module is located at the path /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app.
OK


7 / 11
Inside the configuration directory, we have already added the variables.tf and the provider.tf file. Inspect them.
What type of variable is region?
variable "region" {
    type = map
    default = {
        "us-payroll" = "us-east-1"
        "uk-payroll" = "eu-west-2"
        "india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"
    }

variable "region" {
    type = map
    default = {
        "us-payroll" = "us-east-1"
        "uk-payroll" = "eu-west-2"
        "india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"
    }
"india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"




8/11
What is the default value of the key called india-payroll for the variable region?
"india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"


9 / 11
What is the default value of the key called india-payroll for the variable ami?
"india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"
variable "ami" {
    type = map
    default = {
        "us-payroll" = "ami-24e140119877avm"
        "uk-payroll" = "ami-35e140119877avm"
        "india-payroll" = "ami-55140119877avm"
    }
}

  "india-payroll" = "ami-55140119877avm"



10 / 11
Now, update the main.tf of the root module to call the child module located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app. Adhere to the following specifications:

module name: payroll_app
This module expects two mandatory arguments:

a. app_region - use the values from variable called region

b. ami - use the values from the variable called ami
The values for these two arguments should be selected based on the workspace you are on.


For example, if on us-payroll workspace, the app_region should be us-east-1 and the ami ami-24e140119877avm OR for uk-payroll, the app_region should be eu-west-2 and the ami ami-35e140119877avm e.t.c .

Once ready, run terraform init. You don't have to create(apply) the resources yet!
Refer to the README.md file located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app to see how to use this module.  

main.tf
module "payroll_app" {
  source = "/root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app"

  app_region = lookup(var.region, terraform.workspace)

  ami = lookup(var.ami, terraform.workspace)

}

apply log:
module.payroll_app.aws_s3_bucket.payroll_data: Creating...
module.payroll_app.aws_dynamodb_table.payroll_db: Creating...
module.payroll_app.aws_s3_bucket.payroll_data: Creation complete after 0s [id=us-east-1-flexit-payroll-alpha-22001c]

module.payroll_app.aws_instance.app_server: Creation complete after 10s [id=i-2b048e728c8b39248]

Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.



11 / 11
Now, using the same configuration, create the resources on all three workspaces that you created earlier!

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† us-payroll on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform workspace list
  default
  india-payroll
  uk-payroll
* us-payroll

‚ùØ terraform workspace select india-payroll 
Switched to workspace "india-payroll".
tearraform apply

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† india-payroll on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) took 19s 
‚ùØ terraform workspace select uk-payroll
